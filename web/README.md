## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for local verification to the ignored `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `bun run build:embedded`

Runs the normal build and then deliberately refreshes the committed `embedded`
bundle used by Rust's `embed-web` feature.

## Deployment
